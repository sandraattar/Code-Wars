## Multiples 3_5

-If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

-Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

-Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.


## Multiplication
This kata is about multiplying a given number by eight if it is an even number and by nine otherwise.

## Opposite Number
-Very simple, given a number, find its opposite.
-Examples:
-1: -1
-14: -14

## Reversed Array
-Convert number to reversed array of digits
-Given a random number:

-C#: long;
-C++: unsigned long;
-You have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.

-Example:
-348597 => [7,9,5,8,4,3]

## Average of array
-Return the average of the given array rounded down to its nearest integer.

-The array will never be empty.

## Mumbling
-This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

-Examples:
-accum("abcd");    // "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
-accum("RqaEzty"); // "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
-accum("cwAt");    // "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"

## The Museum of Incredible Dull Things
-Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

-Don't change the order of the elements that are left.
